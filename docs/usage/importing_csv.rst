Importing a CSV file
====================

Superset allows users to import data from a CSV file. The way to do this is
documented in the `superset FAQ <https://superset.apache.org/faq
.html#can-i-upload-and-visualize-csv-data>`__.

The CSV file can be generated by exporting a spreadsheet as comma separated
values.
